+ Unix and Linux Power the World
- Unix is an operating system dating from the 1970s at Bell Labs.  
- Pretty much everything except Windows is Unix-like.
- Linux is a 25-year old `flavor' of Unix... so is Mac OS X.
- If you have a smartphone, you are most likely \emph{already} a Unix user.
- If you've used the web, you've been served by a Linux machine.
-- Well over half of websites are powered by Linux and Unix.
- 21st century cars will run a flavor of Linux (AGL)

Through the next two lecture, we'll discuss:
! Control
! Types 
! Assignment
! Operators
Some of them will be mixed together.

+ Let's take these one at a time... \tright (See Jupyter Notebook.)

+ Collaborating with Git
# Grab a repository: 
#- \tt{git clone git@github.com:JamesSaxon/test.git}
# Make some changes and commit them.  In the meantime, your collaborator does the same.
# \tt{git pull} to download updates from the server.
# If they conflict, use vim or Atom to resolve this by hand; then stage and recommit.
# Push back up to the server.
#- \tt{git push}
! Let's try an \link{https://github.com/harris-ippp/lectures/blob/master/02/snip/git\_merge\_ex.sh}{example}.

+ Further Assorted Commands
However, there is tremendous flexibility:
- \chred{git pull}:   download and merge updates from a remote server
- \chred{git fetch}:  just downlaod updates from a remote server
- \chred{git reset}:  de-stage files
- \chred{git revert}: undo existing commits
- \chred{git checkout}: switch to a different branch
- \chred{git branch}: show or create a branch
- \chred{git merge}:  merge one branch to another.
- \chred{git stash}: creates temporary $\unsim$branch; revert to a clean directory.
- \chred{git drop}:  get rid of the stash (gone forever)
- \chred{git pop}:   retrieve the changes in the stash.

+ A Few More
You may not need these, but here's a flavor.
- \chred{diff}: displays differences between two files
- \chred{awk}: useful (but abstruse) scripting capabilities.
- \chred{column} will align columns.
- \chred{top}: which programs are taxing the computer the most 
- \chred{history}: what have you done!?
- \chred{hostname} the current computer's name
- \chred{whoami}:  your user name
- \chred{hostname}: the host you're on
- \chred{git} is a powerful tool for versioning files!
