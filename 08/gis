+ Geographic Information Systems: Maps
- People love maps -- emotional response to `seeing yourself.'
- GIS is a huge field.  There are other classes at Harris for this.
-- A lot of work on spatial statistics, etc.
- But huge bang for the buck at the entry level.  Many datasets represent a spatial area or point at a specific time.
-- This is a great index for \emph{joins}.

+ What We'll Cover
\Large{
# Making simple maps with GeoPandas (\tt{pandas}+).
#- Finding and importing shapefiles and geojson (like \tt{read\_csv()}).
#- Projections (briefly). \\ \vspace{1em}
# Indexed and spatial joins.
#- Using the census geolocation API (APIs). 
#- Making a map with real data! \\ \vspace{1em}
# Making a simple \emph{web} (!) map with GeoPandas 
}

- Largely revisiting old material.

+ Shapefiles
- Three forms of geographic objects: points (schools, crimes), lines (roads, rivers), and polygons (lots, census tracts, regions, lakes, etc.).
- Many, many sources for geographic data: \link{http://data.cityofchicago.org/}{data.cityofchicago.org}, the \link{https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html}{US Census}, \link{https://www.usgs.gov/products/maps/gis-data}{USGS},  etc.
- Much of this is provided in `ESRI Shapefiles' (Environmental Systems Research Institute, major GIS company) or in geojson.
-- Of courses, addresses and coordinates (lat/lon) are also geographic locations...
