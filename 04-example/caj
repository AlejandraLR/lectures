+ Simple networks for job transmission

+ The Model

+ What do we want to confirm?

+ Necessary Functionality
- Read in arbitrary graphs
- Implement for job creation, transmission, and loss mechanisms
-- Save each agent's employment record for study
- Calculate employment rates
- Calculate correlations among agents
- Calculate minimum distance between agents

+ A Computational Shortcut
- Normally, the variance is $σ² = E[X²] - E[X]²$.
- But we have only two states (0 and 1), and $x = x²$ for both of them.
- In that case, defining $µ ≡ X̅$,
\[ σ² = µ - µ². \]
- As a reminder, the correlation is 
\[ ρ_{XY} = E[(X-µ_X)(Y-µ_X)]/(σ_X σ_Y). \]
