+ Static and Dynamic Webpages
- Last week we built a \chred{static} webpage, containing a single, fixed file and referencing other frozen resources (pictures).
-- Requesting that file's URL, we'll always see the same thing.
%
- Much of the web is \chred{dynamic}: it evolves over time or as a function of its inputs, without someone literally rewriting the site.
-- N.B.: typically this means `server side' dynamic: the server constructs the resource/site before sending it to you.
-- The \emph{individual resources} (images, videos) in a site are usually static.
%
- Contrast to javascript (not covered), which can modify the page behavior or appearance as you click around (certain menus, web apps, formatting, etc.) and potentially request other resources.
-- Of course, those resources may be dynamic; e.g., gmail powered by AJAX (asynchronous javascript and XML, often actually JSON).

+ The Options for Dynamic Websites
- `Traditional' dynamic web stack is LAMP:
-- Linux + Apache + MySQL (DB) + php.
- Many more options today: other servers (nginx), databases (Postgres, SQLite) and languages (python, Ruby on Rails).
- We'll continue using python, with \chred{Django}.
-- Popular, powerful framework, used by Instagram, Pinterest, The Onion, Washington Post, etc.
-- Want more?  Best tutorials I've ever seen: \link{https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/tutorial01/}{official} and \link{https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/}{Django Girls}.

+ Web Server Gateway Interface
How do we `hook up' python as a server?
- Server forwards requests to python through a `gateway interface' module; python responds with a resource.
- Server \emph{should} handle static resources itself (it's much better at it!); heavy server configuration is beyond the scope of this course.
- Luckily for us, Django provides a development server that is very lightweight and easy to run.

+ What We'll Cover
Like python, a huge realm; choice of material and method very subjective.
- Initial set-up of django and a \chred{site}.
- Create hello/goodbye world \chred{views} and register its URLs.
- Return a \chred{table} from pandas; the same, from csv.
- Build several \emph{very} simple \chred{dynamic} `views.'
- Handling \chred{\ttb{GET}} and \chred{\ttb{POST}} data.
- An introduction to \chred{forms}.
- Return a dynamic \chred{plot} (v. generating `all' the plots in advance).
These are basically the pieces you'll need to make your projects.
>1em
- On Wednesday, we'll make it pretty again, with HTML \emph{templates} and hopefully a bit of bootstrap (pre-built css).

+ Getting Started with Django: A Site
If you have not already done so, install django:
` \pr conda install django
Navigate to a directory where you want to work, then:
` \pr django-admin startproject mysite \\ \pr cd mysite
Run the built-in development server, and check it out!!
` \pr python manage.py runserver \\ ... \\ Django version 1.9.5, using settings \tqs{}mysite.settings\tqs{} \\ Starting development server at \chred{http://127.0.0.1:8000/} \\ Quit the server with CONTROL-C. \\ ...

+ Site Resources
- This created a number of files for us.
- We've already run \tt{manage.py}; we'll also use \tt{mysite/settings.py} and \tt{mysite/urls.py} a lot.

../img/site_resources.png:0.6

+ Getting Started with Django: An App
A site is a collection of (potentially) many \chred{apps}.  Let's make one!
` \pr python manage.py startapp myapp
Just like \tt{startproject}, this creates some files for us.
../img/app_resources.png:0.4

+ Getting Started with Django: A view
Now edit the file \tt{myapp/views.py}, adding these lines:
\pythonexternal{ex/index_app.py}

+ How Do We Find Our Site?
# Tell the site about the app.  In \tt{mysite/urls.py}, add:
#- \pythoninline{from django.conf.urls import include}
#- \pythoninline{url(r'^myapp/', include('myapp.urls')),}
# Tell the app about the view.  In \tt{myapp/urls.py}, put
\pythonexternal{ex/app_urls_1.py}
These are regular expressions, peeling off parts of the URL.

+ Now Run the Web Server Again: 
` \pr python manage.py runserver

../img/dj_hw.png:0.4

+ Let's Recap
# Created a site with \tt{django-admin startproject}.
# Created an app with \tt{python manage.py startapp myapp}.
# Added a view to that app, which returned an \tt{HttpResponse}.
# Hooked up the \tt{urls.py} for the site and app, to create the URL.
# Have a site online!!
>1em
- Normally, we just create and register individual views.
- Let's make a `farewell world' view (prepared for Wednesday!).

+ Using What We've Already Learned
Run functions on a website, leveraging the awesome power of python!
- Let's make a pandas table, and use \tt{df.to\_html()}.
\pythonexternal{ex/simple_table.py}

+ Loading Static Data
- With Django, it's easy to make dynamic sites.  Unfortunately, using static data is a bit of a pain.\footnote{Django has extraordinary database support with Object-Relational Mapping (a different interface to RDBMSs).  \\ If you loaded all your data into your database, this would be the way to go.}
- You will need to load CSV files for your homework and projets.
\pythonexternal{ex/csv_table.py}

+ Collecting Your Static Files
- Let's make a small csv at \tt{myapp/static/myapp/baby.csv}.
- You also need to tell Django where your static files live.
- Set up the static files ROOT, in mysite/settings: \\ \pythoninline{STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')}
- Then run this (and accept):
` \pr python manage.py collectstatic
- We used the `long' path, so that the `collected' files would still have a recognizable pattern.

+++ Dynamic Websites

+ Dynamic Websites: What's so great about Django?
- Strip variables out, in urls.py: this creates `\tt{w}': \\ \pythoninline{url(r'^greet/(?P<w>[A-Za-z\\- ]+)/$', views.greet)}
- Pass these to views:
\pythonexternal{ex/greet.py}
>1em
- Let's create views to add and subtract numbers.

+[fragile] Beginning to Prettify: Templates
- \chred{Templates} allow you to `fill in' holes in websites.
- Good to use variables, but also want to reuse e.g., nav bar.
- So we could write our greeting with a view, like this:
\pythonexternal{ex/template_greet.py}
- And a \tt{myapp/templates/greet.html} as:
\begin{tcolorbox}
\verb|Well hello, {{ who }}!!|
\end{tcolorbox}
- We'll cover this in more detail on Wednesday.

+ Reading \tt{GET} and \tt{POST}
- You don't want users to \emph{have} to edit the URL.
- The first step to fixing this is to be able to read the \tt{GET} and \tt{POST} requests that your website would send.
- This is pretty easy (and it is the same for \tt{POST}):
\pythonexternal{ex/get_reader.py}
- So how do we \emph{send} this data?

+++ Forms

+ HTML Forms
- The standard HTML element for inputing data is a \emph{form}: a collection of radio buttons, check boxes, text input fields of varying lengths, drop-down menus, etc. within \tt{<form></form>} tags.
- Take a look at the source for this simple form:
\centering
\link{https://harris-ippp.github.io/lectures/form.html}{https://harris-ippp.github.io/lectures/form.html}

+ HTML Forms and Django Models
- Django recognizes that there is likely a correspondence between data (objects/databases), forms (for creating objects), and views (for displaying them).  They are all built from \chred{Models}.
-- We won't cover this in depth -- the databases are implemented with an Object Relational-Mapping (ORM, RDBMS interface wrapping SQL) that would be a good deal more work.
-- But you can learn more \link{https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_models/}{here}.
%
- Nevertheless, Models are a useful tool.
-- Instead of manually writing each form, you can create a Django object that will do (a lot of) the work for you.

+ A Minimal Model
Imagine that we want a drop-down selection of US states.
- Many types (\tt{CharField}, \tt{IntegerField}, \&c.) and display methods.
- Create a model inheriting from \tt{django.forms.ModelForm} in \tt{myapp/models.py}:
\DeclareFixedFont{\ttb}{T1}{txtt}{bx}{n}{9} 
\DeclareFixedFont{\ttm}{T1}{txtt}{m}{n}{9}
\pythonexternal{ex/model.py}

+ A Minimal Form
Now writing the form is not so bad (but not intuitive, either).
- The \tt{attrs} is for the html rendering of the element.
\pythonexternal{ex/form.py}

+ A View
\pythonexternal{ex/form_view.py}

+[fragile] Which Requires a Template
\begin{tcolorbox}
\verb|{% if state %}| \\
\verb|    I hear you, {{ state }}!!| \\
\verb|{% endif %}| \\
\verb|| \\
\verb|<form action="{{ form_action }}"|
\verb|      method="{{ form_method }}">| \\
\verb|  {{ form.as_p }}| \\
\verb|</form>|
\end{tcolorbox}

+ Dynamic Plots
Make and return plots on the fly.  (Brilliant or misguided?)
>0.5em
- Each visitor wants a plot with specific parameters.  Can't put them all in the same place (overwrite), but can't save them all, either (space).  
%
- On the other hand, most of what you generate will be the $\unsim$same.  Making new plots for every single visitor is expensive.  
%
- Depending on the parameters of your website, could generate `all' possibilities and serve them statically.  Faster but less flexible.
Other libraries (Bokeh) build plots with javascript from data...

+ Creating Plots on the Fly: A Recipe
Looks like a lot, but just two tricks:
# Write to bytes instead of a file.
# Return the bytes as \tt{content\_type = \chred{"image/png"}}.
