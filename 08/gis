+ Geographic Information Systems: Maps
People love maps -- emotional response to `seeing yourself.'
- GIS is a huge field.  There are other classes at Harris for this.
-- A lot of work on spatial statistics, etc.
- But huge bang for the buck at the entry level.
-- Easy to make compelling graphics.
-- Many datasets represent a spatial area or point at a specific time. \\ \chred{$⟹ $} Great potential for \emph{joins}!

- Largely revisiting old material.

+ Shapefiles
- Three forms of geographic objects: points (schools, crimes), lines (roads, rivers), and polygons (lots, census tracts, regions, lakes, etc.).
- Many, many sources for geographic data: \link{http://data.cityofchicago.org/}{data.cityofchicago.org}, the \link{https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html}{US Census}, \link{https://www.usgs.gov/products/maps/gis-data}{USGS},  etc.
- Much of this is provided in `ESRI Shapefiles' (Environmental Systems Research Institute, major GIS company) or in geojson.
-- Shapefiles come zipped with a lot of other files, it's the shp you want.
-- Let's browse: \link{http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2015/shp/}{census shapefiles}.
- Addresses may be geocoded and coordinates are also points!

+ Loading a Shapefile with GeoPandas
- \chred{GeoPandas} simply adds a geometry series to a pandas DataFrame.
- It is tightly integrated with \emph{many} other geographic programs, among them \chred{fiona} for reading geojson/shapefiles and \chred{shapely} for geometric operations (intersections, etc.).
- Really easy to import! Both shapefiles and geojson: 
` import geopandas as gpd \\ gdf = gpd.read\_file("myfile.shp") \\ gdf.plot() \# WOW!!!!
- All of the `standard' dataframe operations (slicing, indexing, merging) are still available.

+ Making a Slightly Better Map 
- Let's restrict ourselves to the contiguous 48 states.
- Make a mask to get rid of Alaska and Hawaii (STATEFP 2 and 15), and the territories (STATEFP $≥ 57$).
- We can also use a better projection: \tt{gpd.to\_crs(epsg=2163)}.
../img/gpd_world.png; ../img/gpd_contiguous.png; ../img/gpd_us_aea.png

+ Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) \tright{\link{https://xkcd.com/977/}{xkcd}}
- To make maps, we need a description of the shape of Earth (an ellipsoid) and an origin/center.  This is called a \chred{datum}.
- We also need a \chred{projection} from 3D to 2D.
- These are standardized in \textcolor{chred}{EPSG codes}:
--[4269] By default, GeoPandas uses a Plate-Car\'ee projection: a mapping of longitude and latitude lines to horizontal and vertical lines (gross).
--[3857] Most online maps use web Mercator, which is conformal (preserves shapes/angles) but much-maligned.
--[2163] Albers Equal Area is a good conic projection for the US. $✔$
- Inappropriate projections make maps look stupid.

+ Joins
Several distinct goals:
# Visualize a dataset as a map (join it to a shapefile).
# Attribute join on two datasets with matching geometries.
#- Don't care about the geometry, just use it!
# Datasets with different geometries (e.g., points and polygons).
#- Use a spatial join; may not care about map!

+ Attribute Join 
- Attribute joins are the joins we've already been doing with pandas.  
- Prepare them for the join by matching the indices (state codes).
>1em
Two examples:
# Single mothers in the United States.
#- Join the state shapes to data from the (\link{http://api.census.gov/data/2014/acs5/profile?for=state:*\&get=DP02\_0037PE}{census API}).
# Voting returns in Pennsylvania from the election return \link{http://www.electionreturns.pa.gov/ENR\_New/api/ElectionReturn/GetCountyBreak?officeId=1\&districtId=1\&methodName=GetCountyBreak\&electionid=undefined\&electiontype=undefined\&isactive=undefined}{site}

+ Choropleth Maps: Shaded Areas
- Easy to make basic, beautiful choropleth maps!
\pythonexternal{scraps/choropleth.py}
- The built-in method also allows for \tt{quantiles} (default), \tt{equal\_intervals} (linear), and \tt{fisher\_jenks}.
-- Fisher Jenks defines categories by minimizing the in-group variance , and maximizing the between-group variance.
-- Most lay-people will only understand equal intervals!!
- There are many, many \link{http://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps\_reference.html}{colormaps}.
- The defaults only allow 9 breaks; see \tt{Adanced.ipynb} for a gradient.

+ Point to Polygon: Spatial Joins
- GeoPandas provides many powerful geometric operations.
- Spatial joins (\tt{sjoin}) use the geometry as you might expect, : \\ \pythoninline{gpd.sjoin(pt_df, poly_df, how = 'left', op = 'within')}
-- You can also do \tt{\tqs{}contains\tqs{}}, \tt{\tqs{}within\tqs{}}, or \tt{\tqs{}intersects\tqs{}}.
- This joins rows with locations (points) in one dataframe, to regions (polygons) in the other.

+ Building a GeoDataFrame from Scratch
- We also need to be able to create a GeoDataFrame from scratch.
- A GeoDataFrame, as we've said, is just a DataFrame with a geometry.
- So we need to build the GeoSeries...
- In this case, the GeoSeries consists of a list of points, which we can construct as 
` import from shapely.geometry import Point \\ pt = Point(x, y)
- Then create a GeoDatFrame, by setting the geoemtry and crs:
` gpd.GeoDataFrame(crime\_df, crs = tract\_df.crs, geometry=geometry)

! Example: associate murders to \\ census tracts and community areas.

+ A Simple Web Map \tright{\tt{scraps/web\_folium.py}}
- Folium creates a powerful javascript map on OpenStreetMap.
- Really nice interface, easily embedded in other sites:

../img/folium.png

+[fragile] Other Folium Features
- You can plot a collection of points with \tt{GeoJson}, but you can get somewhat more control with 
\begin{tcolorbox}
\verb|folium.Marker([41.7855052, -87.5971531], | \\
\verb|              popup='Harris School').add_to(map) |
\end{tcolorbox}
- See also e.g., \tt{CircleMarker}, \tt{RegularPolygonMarker}, etc.
- Full documentation \link{https://folium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html}{here}.
> 1em
- We'll come back to this after our last example.

+ Geocoding
- Often, we have latitudes and longitudes (ready to be wrapped as points), but \emph{addresses}.
- Geocoding is the process of turning addresses into coordinates.
- Many geocoding services can additionally provide census tracts, counties, etc. $⟹ $ Huge time saver!

+[fragile] Nominatim/\tt{geopy} 
- \tt{geopy} plugs into the OpenStreetMap `Nominatim' API.
- Super easy to use!!
\begin{tcolorbox}
\verb|from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim| \\
\verb|nom = Nominatim()| \\
\verb|location = nom.geocode("1155 E. 60th St, Chicago 60637")| \\
\verb|location|
\end{tcolorbox}

+[fragile] Census API
- The Census \link{https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/Geocoding\_Services\_API.html}{geocoding API} matches tracts in \link{https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/geographies/address?street=4600+Silver+Hill+Rd\&city=Suitland\&state=MD\&benchmark=Public_AR_Census2010\&vintage=Census2010_Census2010\&layers=14\&format=json}{geography} endpoint
-- Also standard \link{https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/locations/address?street=4600+Silver+Hill+Rd\&city=Suitland\&state=MD\&zip=20746\&benchmark=Public_AR_Census2010\&format=json}{location} mode.
- Capable of up to 1000 addresses at a time in batch mode:
\begin{tcolorbox}
\fontsize{8.5}{12} \selectfont
\verb|curl -F addressFile=@short.csv -F layers=9 \| \\
\verb|     -F vintage=ACS2015_Current \| \\
\verb|     -F benchmark=Public_AR1_Current \| \\
\verb|     https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/geographies/addressbatch|
\end{tcolorbox}

+[fragile] Geocoding in GeoPandas
- GeoPandas has \tt{geopy} built-in, with google, bing, yahoo, openmapquest, or nominatim.
-- Nominatim is great, but has a 1-second request delay.
-- Some of the others require API keys for large numbers of requests.
\begin{tcolorbox}
\verb|gpd.tools.geocode(["London", "Paris", | \\
\verb|                   "New York", "Hong Kong"]) |
\end{tcolorbox}
- Of course you can also `geocode' areas with \tt{contains()}:
` geo\_df[geo\_df.contains(pt)]["NAME"]

+ Second Folium Example
- Make a map of places represented in this class (points and countries).
- Let's curl these shapefiles for the world:
